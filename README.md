# Omniline Budget Tracker

![Launch](https://i.imgur.com/flTcbdm.png)


## Description

This is an online/offline budget tracking program. The assignment provided some starter code and I was asked to connect the user interface and the back-end so that data could be input while offline and would then show up when the connection has resumed.

The basic functionality of this is a budget tracker that allows the user to input an amount, then select whether to add or subtract that amount from the existing total. This streamlined design allows the app to showcase its true nature. When offline, any data that has been entered will be added to the database upon re-connection. This allows users with spotty internet connections to keep their database up-to-date.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions for ways to improve this app, or if you notice any bugs, please email me with the repository name and your advice. 


## Tests

To run tests, right click on the screen and select `Inspect`. From there, go to the `Network` tab and below that click the `No Throtling` option. In the drop down, select `Offline`. From there you can enter any information you want. When you change the throtling setting back to `No Throtling` (or honestly anything other than `Offline`) the data should sync with the database. You can add more data or reset the page in order to make sure.
